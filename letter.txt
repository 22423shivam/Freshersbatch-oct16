Re: enrollment in HIS393

Dear Prof. Price,

I was told to enrol in this class by someone, I don't know who. It seems like kind of a bad idea but I'm going to do it anyway because I don't have any ideas of my own and anyway I always do what I'm told. I have a couple of questions though, can you please answer them? 

Assignments

Are the assignments actually required, or can I just say I did them?  In particular I am concerned about the following:

- Assignment 1
- Assignment 2
- All the rest of the assignments
